<h2>Signature Ability</h2>

</map>
<h3>Fault Line</h3>
<p>This is Breach's signature ability,once used it gets recharged every 30 seconds.This ability is one of the best in the enitre game if used by an expirenced breach player as they can efficently use these on high concentration of defenders on site or effectively stop a push by attackers.<br />It also acts a good ability to lockdown key chokepoints of the map.<br />It also works well with agents who act as fast entry such as Jett and Raze.Breach will stun a lane of the site and these agents can fast entry and get picks with little to no resistance.<br />
A good breach player will always know when to pair his abilities with his own kit and when to help his teammates with it.<br /></p>
<h2>Basic abilities</h2>
<img src="D:\Aayush\downloads\2-breach-basic-ability-flashpoint.jpg" usemap="#image_map">
<h3>Flashpoint</h3>
<p>This ability when used effictively and efficiently causes a lot of trouble for deffenders on site as these flashes are almost undodgable if used unexpectedly and even in the heat of battle can be a good tool to get the upperedge as they do not require the user to peek out of cover to throw these flashes and can be used while behind cover.<br />
Breach flashes are notoriously hard to learn as a new player runs the risk of flashing one's own teammate but they still have a lower rate of accidental flashes than some flash agents like Yoru and phoenix as these fashes are thrown and run a lot higher risk of flashing teammates.<br />
Using breach's flashes on places that defenders don't expect them from is a pretty powerful ability in its own,Breach flashes are thrown on walls and travel to the other side so boxes in the middile of a site can act as deep flash points for flashing defenders who might be playing backsite or may be rotating to support on a site.<br />
Paring this with other flashes such as Phoneix and espicaly Reyna's flash can help clear a site with almost no resistance.

<h3>Aftershock</h3>
<p>This ability requires a lot of skill in some usecase and almost no skill in others.One such usecase where it requires no skill to use it is when pushing an enemy out of a hiding spot or when going for a kill after stunning an enemy.This ability has almost no usecase for teammates but can be paired with abilties that deny mobility to get easy picks on enemies.<br />
The only usecase of this abililty that requires some semblence of skill is using it to get enemies off the spike other than this it has almost no other skill based niche.</p>
<h2>Ultimate Ability</h2>
<img src="D:\Aayush\downloads\4-breach-ultimate-ability-rolling-thunder.jpg" usemap="#image_map">
<h3>Rolling thunder</h3>
<p>This abiltiy is the ultimate ability of Breach,it is a hard hitting ultimate as it can cover an entire site or a large portion of it in it.<br />
It is like the fault line but on setroids it has a larger radius has knockback so when it hits an enemy they are flung in the air has a higher stun rate so they move slower shoot slower with a good team that would make good use of this ultimate the entire enemy team is teriffied of this ultimate as this ultimate going off is followed with five attackers flooding into the site and blowing anyone they see to smithereens.<br />
Not only does it work great on attack it works even better on defending as this ultimate can single handedly stop an entire enemy push and result in the opposite of what the enemy team wanted,a counterpush by the defenders which would ninety percent of the time result in a defender win for the round.<br />
Some skilled player using omen and yoru can save themselves from the wrath of this Ultimate going off as Yoru can teleport to reletive safety and omen can either teleport away from the radius of the ult or teleport where the ult has already been through as the Breach ult hits in layer and not all in one go.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>In the hands of an experienced Breach player this agent is a menace to fight againt as he can rain down seemingly an endless barage of flashes and stuns which is very hard to defend against but this can be a hectice thing to manage as you the player need to be in front so as to not flash your own teammates or stun them while they might be taking a fight as this may lead to a lot of cussing and a bad taste of you to your teammates.<br />
With this i hope you learned something new about my faviourate agent and i hope it will also help you learn how to play this agent a lot better.</p>
